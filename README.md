Writing Exercise Questions (pick one): 
1.	Most decisions are made with analysis, but some are judgment calls not susceptible to analysis due to time or information constraints.  Please write about a judgment call you’ve made recently that couldn’t be analyzed.  It can be a big or small one, but should focus on a business issue.  What was the situation, the alternatives you considered and evaluated, and your decision making process?  Be sure to explain why you chose the alternative you did relative to others considered. 
2.	What is the most inventive or innovative thing you’ve done?  It doesn’t have to be something that’s patented. It could be a process change, product idea, a new metric or customer facing interface – something that was your idea. It cannot be anything your current or previous employer would deem confidential information.  Please provide us with context to understand the invention/innovation.  What problem were you seeking to solve?  Why was it important? What was the result? Why or how did it make a difference and change things?
